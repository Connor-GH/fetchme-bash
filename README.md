# fetchme-easy
Like fetchme, written POSIX-noncompliant shell. Instead of Neofetch ASCII art, Distros have their names as the ASCII art and it tends to look pretty good!

#Distros currently supported:
* Void Linux 
* Arch Linux
* Debian
* Gentoo (SystemD and OpenRC)
* Artix (Runit and OpenRC)
* Ubuntu
* Solus
* Pop!_OS
* Manjaro
* OpenSUSE

Versus fetchme:
* Under half the file space
* 30% faster (on my system)
* Easier to read
* Adding a new distro is MUCH faster
## Wayland support is not in sight
